# Alexa Copilot
Alexa Copilot is a voice controlled copilot for FlightGear flight simulator. The aim is to fully automate the tasks typically performed by copilot and reduce pilot's workload so that he/she can focus on flying. 

# Setup Instructions
Please follow our [setup wiki](https://github.com/aditya2592/alexa_copilot/wiki) to setup Alexa Copilot on your Linux/Mac machine. Since the code is based on Python and FlightGear it should work on Windows as well but it has't been tested.

# Running Alexa Copilot
Please follow [our wiki](https://github.com/aditya2592/alexa_copilot/wiki) to run Alexa Copilot. Current implementation supports autostart of engines, priming, throttle and mixture level change in FlightGear for the Cesna 172P Skyhawk aircraft. The wiki also contains a demo video for this. We are working to add more controls.
